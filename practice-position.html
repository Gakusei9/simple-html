    Never forget that with discpline nothing is impossible, always show up even if it's for ten minute. Those ten minute could go and will go a long way that for sure. It's not only you, it's your parent, brothers, cousins and most importantly yourself, lead by example. Not acheiving our goal it's one of the best way to be unhappy. A wise man once said that the best cheat code in life it's to never stop.
